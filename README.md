# ubuntu_20_installations
Required programs for my ubuntu environment

## Instructions

- for a fresh system, you have to install git manually.

```
# install git via cli
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git -y

```
 - clone the repository.

 - run `cd linux_setup`
 - run `./install.sh` 

### To contribute
- some of the scripts in the gh actions are commented because they have not been tested. You may start with this.

- also you can include additional scripts for specific programs you use.

PS: Use the official program's documentation. It will save you a lot of stress.
